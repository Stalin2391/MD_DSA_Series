# The Painterâ€™s Partition Problem:

## Question:

## Type 1:

Given an array arr[] and k, where the array represents the boards and each element of the given array represents the length of each board. k numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint. The task is to find the minimum time to get this job done by painting all the boards under the constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards. say board [2, 3, 4] or only board [1] or nothing but not board [2, 4, 5].

``` 
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 35
Explanation: The most optimal way will be: 
ðŸ”¹ Painter 1 allocation : [5,10], 
ðŸ”¹ Painter 2 allocation : [30], 
ðŸ”¹ Painter 3 allocation : [20, 15], 
ðŸ”¸ Job will be done when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(5 + 10, 30, 20 + 15) = 35


Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: The most optimal way to paint: 
ðŸ”¹ Painter 1 allocation : [10, 20, 30], 
ðŸ”¹ Painter 2 allocation : [40], 
ðŸ”¸ Job will be complete at time = 60

```

## Optimized Idea: (Binary Search):


```java

public static boolean isCheck(int[] arr, int k, int time){
    int N = arr.length;
    int painterCount = 1;
    int currentTime = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        if(currentTime + arr[i] <= time){
            currentTime += arr[i];
        }else {
            painterCount++;
            currentTime = arr[i]; // If adding the current board exceeds maxTime, assign it to a new painter
        }
    }
    if(painterCount <= k) return true;

    return false;
}

public static int minimizeTime(int[] arr, int k){

    int l = 0;  // The minimum time must be at least the largest single board length
    int r = 0;  // The minimum possible time will be the max board size, the maximum possible time will be the sum of all boards

    int N = arr.length;
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
       r += arr[i];
       l = Math.max(l, arr[i]);
    }

    int ans = r;

    while(l <= r){
        int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;

        // If it's possible to paint the boards with this mid time, try for a smaller max time
        if(isCheck(arr, k, mid)){
            ans = mid;
            r = mid - 1;
        }else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

```

## Type 2:

Problem Description

Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.

### NOTE:
1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003.

```

Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = 5
 C = [1, 10]

Input 2:

 A = 10
 B = 1
 C = [1, 8, 11, 3]

```

```

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
 Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
 There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
 ans = 50 % 10000003

Explanation 2:

 Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3 
 and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
 ans = 11 % 10000003


```

```java

public int paint(int A, int B, int[] C) {
    long l = 0, r = 0;

    int N = C.length;

    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        r += C[i];
        l = Math.max(l, C[i]);
    }

    int mod = 10000003;
    long ans = r * B;

    while(l <= r){
        long mid = l + (r - l) / 2;

        if(isCheck(C, A, mid)){
            ans = mid * B;
            r = mid - 1;
        }else {
            l = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return (int) (ans % mod);
}
public boolean isCheck(int[] arr, int A, long time){
    int paintersCount = 1;
    long currentTime = 0;
    int N = arr.length;

    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        if(currentTime + arr[i] <= time){
            currentTime += arr[i];
        }else {
            paintersCount++;
            currentTime = arr[i];
        }
    }
    if(paintersCount <= A){
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}


```

# Aggressive Cows :

Problem Description

Farmer John has built a new long barn with N stalls. Given an array of integers A of size N where each element of the array represents the location of the stall and an integer B which represents the number of cows.

To prevent the cows from hurting each other, John wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?


Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format

Return the largest minimum distance possible among the cows.

```

Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = 3
Input 2:

A = [1, 2]
B = 2
