## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects." 
- These objects represent real-world entities and interact with one another to perform tasks.
- OOPS is designed to make software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain by organizing code into objects that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
