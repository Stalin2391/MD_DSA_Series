## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects." 
- These objects represent real-world entities and interact with one another to perform tasks.
- OOPS is designed to make software more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain by organizing code into objects that encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).


## Object

An **object** is an instance of a class. It contains both data (attributes) and methods (functions or operations) that operate on the data.

**Example:**
A "Car" object might have attributes like `color`, `model`, and `year`, and methods like `start()` and `stop()`.

## Class

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects.

**Example:**
A "Car" class might define the properties and methods that all car objects will have.
